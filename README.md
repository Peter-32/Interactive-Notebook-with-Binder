### Question

Is Binder a good option for an interactive dashboard?

### Hypothesis

It works well to allow the public to access to your dashboard.  It also has privacy settings.

### Data Sources

iris dataset

### Data Descriptions

##### Features

- sepal length (cm)
- sepal width (cm)
- petal length (cm)
- petal width (cm)

##### Label

- Three types of flowers

### Steps

- X Data Explorer
- X Choose favorite plots
- X Create those plots in Seaborn
  - X 1 var: Joy  
  - X Colored pairplot or scatterplot
  - X parallel plot
- X Git push
- X Upload to binder.com

### Conclusion

- Pros: I could host Jupyter notebooks.
- Cons: I was unable to install modules in Binder.  Also, I was unable to use Jupyter dashboard locally & on Binder.

I will use Atom or DataBricks instead of Jupyter + Binder.  Binder doesn't have privacy settings and I couldn't figure out how to install Python modules in Binder.
